Physio package overview
=======================


What can be done with physio toolbox ?
--------------------------------------

**Features**:

  * respiration cycle detection
  * respiration cycle features (amplitude, duration, volumes ...)
  * simple preprocess on signal : filter using scipy and smoothing
  * ecg peak detection
  * ecg/hrv metrics (time domain and freq domain)
  * rsa : new approach to get cycle-per-cycle metrics
  * cyclic deformation machinery : a simple strecher of any signal to cycle template
  * simple reader of micromed and brainvision using neo
  * "automagic" parameters for differents species


Why another python toolbox for ecg and respiration ?
----------------------------------------------------

:py:mod:`physio` python toolbox has been develop in the `CMO <https://www.crnl.fr/fr/equipe/cmo>`_
(Codage Olfaction MÃ©moire) team of Centre de Recherche en Neuroscience de Lyon (CRNL).

The  **CMO** team has a long term experience in analysing respiration and neural events. See this 2006 paper
`Respiratory cycle as time basis: An improved method for averaging olfactory neural events <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16246424/>`_

Many pieces of our codes for analysing respiration were never published and not released properly as open source despite
the fact we are highly contributing to many open source projects (neo, spikeinterface, ephyviewer).

Also some methods (cyclic deformation on respiratory signal) is some kind of home made signature of many analyses from
the team, having a public tool could be usefull for others.

And finally, about the RSA (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia), we truely believe that respiration and ecg must be analysed
jointly, the developemment of this toolbox have been mainly motivated by this simple idea.


Parameters handling
-------------------

Detecting respiratory cycles and ECG cycles have many nested parameters  : filetering, smotthing, threshold, ...
This parameters have a high impact on the results and are totaly species/protocol/state dependent.
This parameters also depend on the sensor used. For instance  : nasal airflow vs inductive belt vs plethysmo.

:py:mod:`physio` come with some predefined parameters set for a few species (human, rodent) and sensor
By default this parameters set should work without too much pain. For better results they can be finely tuned to get
better results on cycle detection.

TODO some code examples.


Design choice
-------------

* simplicity: easy to read, easy to understand, easy to hack
* function only (no custum class or complicated structures). input/ouput are numpy arrays or pandas dataframe.
* frugality : few features
* few dependencies: numpy, pandas, scipy and neo (for data reading)


Comparison to other toolboxes
-----------------------------

:py:mod:`physio` is not the first toolbox on the open-source market to analyse ECG and respiratory signals!
Here a very very biased and unfair comparison to some other well-known toolboxes used by many accademic labs.
*If you are one author of theses toolboxes, first many thanks for sharing your code and apologize for this comment.*
*Feel free to comment our toolbox*


* `**neurokit2** <https://neuropsychology.github.io/NeuroKit>`_: A very impressive, generalist and widely used python
  toolbox to analyse neurophysiogical signals (EEG, resp, ECG, EMG, EDA).
  The quality of respiratory cycles detction and ECG rpeak detection was not accurate enough to be used without hacking
  to analyse our data.
  Also, we get the feeling that code is really hard to follow and hack (deep nested function and too 
  sophisticated data structure).

* `**py-ecg-detectors** <https://github.com/berndporr/py-ecg-detectors>`_: One of the best implemention (to our knowledge)
  of many R peak detector. But this package do not handle respiration. And many the proposed algorithms do not detect 
  the extact position of the R peaks  (this inherents to methods and not the implemention!).

* `**biospy** <https://biosppy.readthedocs.io/>`_ : this has a very annoying dependency to tinker and opencv.
  Implement a godd R peak detector with Hamilton method. Have limited documentation. Do not have RSA analyse.

* `**pyhrv** <https://pyhrv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_: depend on biospy and have the same annoying dependencies list.
  The ECG peak is done on biospy. The ECG metrics (time and freq domain) are similar :py:mod:`physio` but we prefer
  the pandas DataFrame approach, this lead to much comptact code.

* `breathmetrics <https://github.com/zelanolab/breathmetrics>`_ : a toolbox mainly around the respiration. Unfortunatly
  still target matlab users. Have strong assumtion about "pauses" in the respiratory signal (which is true) but the pause
  between inhalation and exhalation can be somehow an annoying assumption. Most of respiratory cycles metrics are also
  handle by :py:mod:`physio`. breathmetrics have GUI written in matlab which do not embrace the frugality
  approach of :py:mod:`physio`
